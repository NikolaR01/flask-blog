# flask-blog
A simple blog made with flask

The blog is still in development but has some cool features, it uses MySQL as a database and i have provided a create_db file that will create
the required tables for the website to work


# TODO - for now

Filter out requirements.txt file as it is a little bloated

Add image upload
